					<img src="images/bonnie.JPG" alt="Bonnie Frieden" class="bonnie"><p class="bio">Welcome to my little corner of the internet. A few years ago I started teaching myself how to code and fell in love and haven't stopped since. </p>
					<p class="bio">I started with php, SQL and javascript. Great languages to learn, but I had no idea how to use html and css to add sturcture and beauty to my projects. Neither did I now how to transfer my projects to the internet. I didn't want to be the only one enjoying my work, I wanted to share what I had created with others. So, I decided to go back to the basics. That's why I'm taking this class. To add a proper foundation to what I already know and create my first real website.</p>

					<h2>Weeks 14-16</h2>
					<time datetime="2016-05-10">May 1, 2016</time>
					<p>Finished ahead of schedule, thanks to spring break and having a few weekend coding sessions. The last chapter in the book introduced me to javascript and jquery. Now jquery is supposed to simplify the coding process because you are connected to a library of resuable javascript code and plugins. Just a few lines of code and you have a very cool interactive website. I found it difficult for me to understand and use personally, I think its because I'm not familiar with javascipt. Next class is Javascript, so then the jquery should be easy to use in the future. Added javascipt onhover moves to some links. I used javascript form controls to enforce an appropriate email on my form. Also, as promised my photo gallery was updated using a basic jquery fotorama plugin. I did a google search to find the code, the code in the book and data files were too complicated for me. I'm pleased with the result. Since class is finished for me, I need to back up all my files and move them to my own website.  </p>

					<h2>Weeks 11-13</h2>
					<time datetime="2016-04-10">April 4,2016</time>
					<p>Focus on use of media, commerce and advertising. I have added a photo gallery during this time. Starting with pictures of my two cats, because the internet doesn't have enough pictures of cats. This photo gallery makes use of the css transition property. I'm hoping to upgrade it with a few more images and adding javascript. I have a strong interest in IT security, so I enjoyed reading about the different types of encryption methods used to secure a website for commercial use. Not one for promoting, or marketing for that matter, but I do feel that SEO and knowledge of search engines is vital to a web developer. The jobs I have seen posted desire SEO skills.</p>

					<h2>Weeks 7-10</h2>
					<time datetime="2016-03-28">March 28, 2016</time>
					<p>More focus and emphasis on accessability and testing. Didn't realize there was more to web development than just looks and function. I can read html and understand how the elements work. Css, the same, I can read it and know how my page is supposed to look. But trying to remember all the little details regarding accessability and making sure screen readers can read your page, is something different. Forms are super easy to make. I just need to figure out how I can process my contact form with out the need for a server side script. I found a few contenders, such as google java scripts and some online form processor apps. We shall see. I found a few free lance web developers and their online portfolio's. So I have a few ideas as to how I want to build my portfolio. I was quite pleased with the results of my validation and accessability testing on my personal site. Had very few errors and everything looks good. Just a few improvements.</p>

                    <h2>Weeks 1-6</h2>
					<time datetime="2016-02-29"> February 29, 2016</time>
				   <p>I learned so much these last 6 weeks. Everything from what is the internet to desiging for web access. The fun part is coding my own website by hand, making mistakes and learning how to undo them. My favorite chapter so far has been chapter 6. In this chapter I discovered the true power of CSS and how to use it in creating aesthetically pleasing websites. </p>
